In this short post, I talk about why I'm moving away from using function `apply`.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(width = 95)
```

## With matrices

It's okay to use `apply` with a dense matrix, although you can often use an equivalent that is faster.

```{r}
N <- M <- 8000
X <- matrix(rnorm(N * M), N)
system.time(res1 <- apply(X, 2, mean))
system.time(res2 <- colMeans(X))
stopifnot(isTRUE(all.equal(res2, res1)))
```

"Yeah, there are `colSums` and `colMeans`, but what about computing standard deviations?"

There are lots of `apply`-like functions in [package {matrixStats}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=matrixStats).

```{r}
system.time(res3 <- apply(X, 2, sd))
system.time(res4 <- matrixStats::colSds(X))
stopifnot(isTRUE(all.equal(res4, res3)))
```

## With data frames

```{r}
head(iris)
apply(head(iris), 2, identity)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/as-matrix.jpg")
```

A DATA FRAME IS NOT A MATRIX (it's a list).

The first thing that `apply` does is converting the object to a matrix, which consumes memory and in the previous example transforms all data as strings (because a matrix can have only one type).

What can you use as a replacement of `apply` with a data frame? 

- If you want to operate on all columns, since a data frame is just a list, you can use `sapply` instead (or `map*` if you are a purrrist).

    ```{r}
    sapply(iris, typeof)
    ```

- If you want to operate on all rows, I recommend you to watch [this webinar](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/thinking-inside-the-box-you-can-do-that-inside-a-data-frame/).

## With sparse matrices

The memory problem is even more important when using `apply` with sparse matrices, which makes using `apply` very slow for such data.

```{r}
library(Matrix)

X.sp <- rsparsematrix(N, M, density = 0.01)

## X.sp is converted to a dense matrix when using `apply`
system.time(res5 <- apply(X.sp, 2, mean))  

system.time(res6 <- Matrix::colMeans(X.sp))
stopifnot(isTRUE(all.equal(res6, res5)))
```

You could implement your own `apply`-like function for sparse matrices by seeing a sparse matrix as a data frame with 3 columns (`i` and `j` storing positions of non-null elements, and `x` storing values of these elements). Then, you could use a `group_by`-`summarize` approach.

For instance, for the previous example, you can do this in base R:

```{r}
apply2_sp <- function(X, FUN) {
  res <- numeric(ncol(X))
  X2 <- as(X, "dgTMatrix")
  tmp <- tapply(X2@x, X2@j, FUN)
  res[as.integer(names(tmp)) + 1] <- tmp
  res
}

system.time(res7 <- apply2_sp(X.sp, sum) / nrow(X.sp))
stopifnot(isTRUE(all.equal(res7, res5)))
```


## Conclusion

Using `apply` with a dense matrix is fine, but try to avoid it if you have a data frame or a sparse matrix.
